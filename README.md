# Algorithms do be here.

Algorithms do things, and they should be learnt. so here I try.

More details when more algorithms appear here.

I should also look into some test-frameworks for each language.

- pytest (python)
- Catch2 (cpp)
- Busted (lua)
- Rust uses crates? Wonder if there is a test-framework in one of those packages.
- Also reminder to check out Zig and Go!
- I need to investigate for JS, Rust and TS.
